Elixir bindings to [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite).

## Installation

You most likely want to use VegaLite in [Livebook](https://github.com/elixir-nx/livebook),
in which case you can call `Mix.install/2`:

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.0"}
])
```

Otherwise you can add the above dependency to your mix.exs.
